    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all your ingredients</li>
        <li>Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven
            over medium heat until well browned.</li>
        <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water.
            Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt,
            Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for
            about 1 ½ hours, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna
            noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and
            rinse with cold water.</li>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2
            tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>To assemble, spread 1 ½ cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a
            9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat
            sauce, overlapping slightly. Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta
            cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese slices.
            Spoon 1 ½ cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with
            1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li>Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan
            cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil
            with cooking spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and
            bake for an additional 25 minutes.</li>
        <li>Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
